# v2.0.0

## 05/08/2023

1. [](#new)
   - BREAKING - restructured blueprint system to improve settings portability. Old settings from v1 are no longer supported due to renamed blueprint variables. See `blueprints.yaml` and `canvas.yaml` for the new variable system. All themes that use `canvas` as a starter are recommended to place all page-level blueprint schemas in `default.yaml` and let the partials and theme templates handle if they must access the values in `default.yaml` This unless you really need to lock a set of settings to a specific template.
   - Depreciated template alias files and transferred alias handling to theme logic. This is to declutter the template list in the admin page settings. See `partials/base.html.twig` for the alias lists. If you explicitly want a template alias to appear in the page settings, you must create a new template file that embeds the official template it stands for and register it in the alias lists in `partials/base.html.twig`.
2. [](#bugfix)
   - Fixed pageflip to only appear if the parent page has a `content.items` defined.
   - Fixed missing description value.
   - Fixed breadcrumbs to only appear in `item`-like pages.
3. [](#improved)
   - Moved breadcrumbs to header. Visible to `item`-like pages only, but can be forced to be shown or hidden through setting `partials.breadcrumbs.toggle` in your page to true or false.
