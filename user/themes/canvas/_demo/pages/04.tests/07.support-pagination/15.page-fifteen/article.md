This is the article template. This is an alias of the `item` template. If you are a theme designer, you can choose to extend this look in the `templates` folder. If you are using the `canvas` theme, don't forget to check the template alias arrays in `partials/base.html.twig`

Dressing up. People just don't do it anymore. We have to change that. Money doesn't buy elegance. You can take an inexpensive sheath, add a pretty scarf, gray shoes, and a wonderful bag, and it will always be elegant. It is difficult to talk about fashion in the abstract, without a human body before my eyes, without drawings, without a choice of fabric - without a practical or visual reality. Fashion is a very stressful place to work because of the demands of doing the shows - no one expects a writer to produce two books a year on the dot - but it's also a very toxic place to work. You have to stay true to your heritage; that's what your brand is about.

I've treated the waistcoat as if it were a corset, so that it becomes the first layer in the process of putting clothes on the body. There is constant motion between layering and revealing. An evening dress that reveals a woman's ankles while walking is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. I love a black wedding dress. I am not interested in the past, except as the road to the future. There has to be a balance between your mental satisfaction and the financial needs of your company.

I have a fantastic relationship with money. I use it to buy my freedom. I always thought what you wore underneath was as important as what you wear on top. Grunge is a hippied romantic version of punk. All I did my first year at Vogue was Xerox. I do not have one theme for each season, I just try to make beautiful clothes all year round.
