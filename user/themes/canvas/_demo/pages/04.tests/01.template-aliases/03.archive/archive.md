title: I am the archive template
---

This is the archive template. This is an alias of the `blog` template. If you are a theme designer, you can choose to extend this look in the `templates` folder. If you are using the `canvas` theme, don't forget to check the template alias arrays in `partials/base.html.twig`

I still appreciate individuality. Style is much more interesting than fashion, really. I think God is the most fantastic designer. I like things simple. You can hide so much behind theatrics, and I don't need to do that any more. Fashion fades, only style remains the same.

You have to always work against what you did before, and even against your taste. I would like to be a one-man multinational fashion phenomenon. I am not interested in shock tactics. I just want to make beautiful clothes. You cannot be creative with people around you. I would like the people that buy my clothes to understand that for me it's one small piece of art.
