title: I am the folder template

This is the folder template. This is an alias of the `blog` template. If you are a theme designer, you can choose to extend this look in the `templates` folder. If you are using the `canvas` theme, don't forget to check the template alias arrays in `partials/base.html.twig`

I didn't like the '80s at all; it was a vulgar moment of fashion. I remember walking the dog one day, I saw a car full of teenage girls, and one of them rolled down the window and yelled, 'Marc Jacobs!' in a French accent. I want to thank all the women who have worn my clothes, the famous and the unknown, who have been so faithful to me and given me so much joy. I don't care about money. I really don't care. I just want to do what I do. I believe in comfort. If you don't feel comfortable in your clothes, it's hard to think of anything else.

You can hide so much behind theatrics, and I don't need to do that any more. Men have got more of a discerning eye. They appreciate cut and details, things that aren't so obvious. They like things that have cachet and gentlemanliness. I love the 2000s because everyone started to love haute couture. I wanted to dress the woman who lives and works, not the woman in a painting. You're only as good as your last collection, which is an enormous pressure.
