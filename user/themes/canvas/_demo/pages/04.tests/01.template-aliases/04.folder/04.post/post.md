This is the post template. This is an alias of the `item` template. If you are a theme designer, you can choose to extend this look in the `templates` folder. If you are using the `canvas` theme, don't forget to check the template alias arrays in `partials/base.html.twig`

Attitude is everything. I get ideas about what's essential when packing my suitcase. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of. Attitude is everything. Insecurity is a waste of time.

Fashion can be this mysterious thing that you can't explain. Confidence. If you have it, you can make anything look good. Attitude is everything. Go to a place where you're not going to be stressed, because a honeymoon itself can be a stressful thing. I get ideas about what's essential when packing my suitcase.

When I was young, I lived like an old woman, and when I got old, I had to live like a young person. Attitude is everything. Fashion can be this mysterious thing that you can't explain. Beauty is perfect in its imperfections, so you just have to go with the imperfections. Confidence. If you have it, you can make anything look good.
