title: I am the blog template
---

This is the blog template. This is intended as the template for showing page collections. A blog template usually should have a `content.items` definition in its frontmatter, but theme designers can code a default collection behavior when there is no `content.items` defined.

Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable. Sometimes the simplest things are the most profound. The great thing about fashion is that it always looks forward. Fashion moves so quickly that, unless you have a strong point of view, you can lose integrity. I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes.

Fashion is about dressing according to what's fashionable. Style is more about being yourself. I am especially grateful that I have been able to keep my own style over the decades, in spite of the many changes that have taken place in the world of fashion and in its business. I feel that things happen for a reason and open up new opportunities. I do not have one theme for each season, I just try to make beautiful clothes all year round. I think it's an old fashioned notion that fashion needs to be exclusive to be fashionable.
