Resouces of Artificial Intelegent 

===

Definisi AI : 
- AI is the science and engineering of making machines to tasks they have never seen and have not been prepared for beforehand - McCarthy (paraphrared)
- AI it the science of making machine capable of performing task that would require intelligence if done by humans - Minsky 
- Intelligence as a general learning ability (tabula rasa) - Locke
- Intelligence a collection of task-specific skills - Darwin
- Intellegence (Locke and McCarthy view) process and skill , task of the skill output of that process. 
- This skill is not intelligence , and displaying skill at any number of tasks does not show intelligence . Intelligence is the ability to deal with new situations. Process to create road using blaze and heavy is not the same with the road is self. 
Forget about human exams. GENERALIZATION is the key question, and it was't at all taken into account in the way human exams are designed. 
Key quantities for conceptualizing intelligent systems GENERALIZATION not exam.
- Fluidity :  Static skills (repository of memorized programs) vs Fluid Intelligence(Synthesize new programs on the fly)
- Operational area : Narrow operational ( low abstrction) vs Broad Operational area of programs used ( high abstruction)
- Information-efficiency : Data-hungry program (acquisition/synthesis) vs Information-efficient program 

Abstraction is the key to generalization.
Transformers are a great type 1 abstraction machine 
But to do we get type 2.0 
Discrete program search : how to learn to reason , descrite program search with deeplearning

Natural Intelligence : combine type one thinking with type two thinking provided by program synthesis. Combine perception and intuition together with explicit step by step reasoing , combine both abstrction , type two by calculate step by step, intuition with type one. Discrete search into a unified super approach
How can system 1 help system 2 ? 
System 2 related techniques involve a lot of enumeration over combinations of things ( walking down graphs/trees with large branching factors) key issue : combinatorial explosion
System 1 : turn a lot of discreate data into a data strucure that enables fast, approximate judgements calls about the target discrete space only feasible if: discrete space has same interpolative 
Key Idea: use these fast-but-maybe-wrong judgement calls to keep combinatorial explosion in check
