Resouces of Artificial Intelegent 

===

Definisi AI : 
- AI is the science and engineering of making machines to tasks they have never seen and have not been prepared for beforehand - McCarthy (paraphrared)
- AI it the science of making machine capable of performing task that would require intelligence if done by humans - Minsky 
- Intelligence as a general learning ability (tabula rasa) - Locke
- Intelligence a collection of task-specific skills - Darwin
- Intellegence (Locke and McCarthy view) process and skill , task of the skill output of that process. 
- This skill is not intelligence , and displaying skill at any number of tasks does not show intelligence . Intelligence is the ability to deal with new situations. Process to create road using blaze and heavy is not the same with the road is self. 
Forget about human exams. GENERALIZATION is the key question, and it was't at all taken into account in the way human exams are designed. 
Key quantities for conceptualizing intelligent systems GENERALIZATION not exam.
- Fluidity :  Static skills (repository of memorized programs) vs Fluid Intelligence(Synthesize new programs on the fly)
- Operational area : Narrow operational ( low abstrction) vs Broad Operational area of programs used ( high abstruction)
- Information-efficiency : Data-hungry program (acquisition/synthesis) vs Information-efficient program
